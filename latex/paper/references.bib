Our deﬁnition is analogous to the standard deﬁnition of the average direct eﬀect, and can be expressed without needing to compare outcomes across multiple randomized experiments. We show that the proposed indirect eﬀect satisﬁes a universal decomposition theorem, whereby the sum of the average direct and indirect eﬀects always corresponds to the average eﬀect of a policy intervention. We also consider a number of parametric models for interference considered by applied researchers, and ﬁnd that our (non-parametrically deﬁned) indirect eﬀect remains a natural estimand when re-expressed in the context of these models.},

  abstractnote = {Exposure mappings facilitate investigations of complex causal eﬀects when units interfere in experiments. Current methods assume that the exposures are correctly speciﬁed. The assumption can, however, not be veriﬁed, and it is questionable in many settings. This paper investigates whether inferences about exposure eﬀects can be drawn when the exposures are misspeciﬁed. The main result is a law of large numbers under weak conditions on the errors introduced by the misspeciﬁcation. In particular, the rate of convergence is determined by the dependence between units' speciﬁcation errors, and consistency is achieved even when the errors are large as long as they are suﬃciently independent. The limiting distribution of the estimator is also discussed. Asymptotic normality is achieved under stronger conditions than those needed for consistency. Similar conditions also facilitate conservative variance estimation.},
