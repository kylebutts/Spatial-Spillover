  abstractnote = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is deﬁned as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefﬁcient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially signiﬁcant causal effects.},

                  We study the local effects of new market-rate housing in low-income areas using microdata on large apartment buildings, rents, and migration. New buildings decrease rents in nearby units by about 6 percent relative to units slightly farther away or near sites developed later, and they increase in-migration from lowincome areas. We show that new buildings absorb many high-income households and increase the local housing stock substantially. If buildings improve nearby amenities, the effect is not large enough to increase rents. Amenity improvements could be limited because most buildings go into already-changing neighborhoods, or buildings could create disamenities such as congestion.},

Using an instrumental variables approach to correct for both measurement error in entry dates and endogeneity of the timing of entry, I ﬁnd that Wal-Mart entry increases retail employment by 100 jobs in the year of entry. Half of this gain disappears over the next ﬁve years as other retail establishments exit and contract, leaving a long-run statistically signiﬁcant net gain of 50 jobs. Wholesale employment declines by approximately 20 jobs due to Wal-Mart’s vertical integration. No spillover effect is detected in retail sectors in which Wal-Mart does not compete directly, suggesting Wal-Mart does not create agglomeration economies in retail trade at the county level.},

To identify the causal e ect of Carnegie libraries on innovation, we use new data on city-level patenting and a novel control group: cities that quali ed to receive a library grant, applied for the program, received preliminary construction approval, but ultimately did not build a Carnegie library. Patenting in recipient towns increased by 8-13 percent in the 20 years following library entry. We show that this increase is concentrated in technology classes that overlap with library holdings. The number of women and immigrant inventors also increased after libraries opened.

Our main results include principled number of bins selection, conﬁdence intervals and bands, hypothesis tests for parametric and shape restrictions of the regression function, and several other new methods, applicable to canonical binscatter as well as higher-order polynomial, covariateadjusted and smoothness-restricted extensions thereof. In particular, we highlight important methodological problems related to covariate adjustment methods used in current practice. We also discuss extensions to clustered data. Our results are illustrated with simulated and real data throughout. Companion general-purpose software packages for Stata and R are provided.

Fourth, employing different coupling approaches, we develop uniform distributional approximations for the undersmoothed and robust bias-corrected t-statistic processes and construct valid confidence bands. In the univariate case, our uniform distributional approximations require seemingly minimal rate restrictions and improve on approximation rates known in the literature. Finally, we apply our general results to three partitioning-based estimators: splines, wavelets, and piecewise polynomials.

Extending existing DD estimates, I document that reforms travel over roads, and have spillover eﬀects in neighbouring non-aﬀected counties.

Using a two-city spatial model, we show that the secular evolution of inter-city and intra-city commuting costs can account for this.

The interpretation of such estimates is complicated by the fact that they reﬂect both partial equilibrium and local general equilibrium eﬀects of the shocks. We propose an approach for recovering estimates of partial equilibrium eﬀects from these cross-regional empirical estimates. The basic idea is to divide the cross-regional estimate by an estimate of the local ﬁscal multiplier, which measures the strength of local general equilibrium ampliﬁcation. We apply this approach to recent estimates of housing wealth eﬀects based on city-level variation, and derive conditions under which the adjustment is exact. We then evaluate its accuracy in a richer general equilibrium model of consumption and housing. The paper also reconciles the positive cross-sectional correlation between house price growth and construction with the notion that cities with larger price volatility have lower housing supply elasticities using a model in which housing supply elasticities are more dispersed in the long run than in the short run.},

A growing class of placebased policies attempts to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities, or regions. Place-based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the United States and throughout the world but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place-based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective? To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place-based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place-based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.},

More generally, we ﬁnd that both state and federal EZs appear to be endogenously selected based on prior changes in poverty and other labor market outcomes. Once we account for this selection, much of the evidence that state and federal EZs reduce poverty largely evaporates, as does most of the evidence for other beneﬁcial effects of enterprise zones, with the main exception of some limited evidence for federal Empowerment Zones. Thus, we conﬁrm the more widely-prevailing view that EZs – and especially state EZs – have for the most part been ineffective at reducing urban poverty or improving labor market outcomes in the United States.},

  title        = {An Honest Approach to Parallel Trends},
  abstractnote = {This paper proposes robust inference methods for diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences and event-study designs that do not require that the parallel trends assumption holds exactly. Instead, the researcher must only impose restrictions on possible violations of the parallel trends assumption, and our methodology then guarantees uniformly valid (“honest”) inference when the imposed restrictions are satisﬁed. We ﬁrst show that ﬁxed length conﬁdence intervals have near-optimal expected length for a practically-relevant class of restrictions. We next introduce a novel inference procedure that accommodates a wider range of restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends, and is based on the observation that inference in our setting is equivalent to testing a system of moment inequalities with a large number of linear nuisance parameters. The resulting conﬁdence sets are consistent, and have optimal local asymptotic power for many parameter conﬁgurations. We recommend researchers conduct sensitivity analyses to show what conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the set of possible violations of parallel trends.},

The inferential target is a generalization of the average treatment eﬀect estimand that marginalizes over potential spillover effects. We show that estimators commonly used to estimate treatment eﬀects under no interference are consistent for the generalized estimand for several common experimental designs under limited but otherwise arbitrary and unknown interference. The rates of convergence depend on the rate at which the amount of interference grows and the degree to which it aligns with dependencies in treatment assignment. Importantly for practitioners, the results imply that if one erroneously assumes that units do not interfere in a setting with limited, or even moderate, interference, standard estimators are nevertheless likely to be close to an average treatment eﬀect if the sample is suﬃciently large. Conventional conﬁdence statements may, however, not be accurate.},

  abstractnote = {For decades, social scientists have been trying to answer causal questions about the effectiveness of certain programs or policies. The conventional methodology for answering such causal questions relies on the “no interference between different units” assumption; that is, a unit’s outcome depends solely on the treatment that the unit is assigned to (or exposed to) and does not depend on the treatment assignment (or exposure) of other units in the population. However, this assumption is likely to be violated in spatial settings because of various spillover, diffusion, and displacement effects. In this paper, we present a case study evaluating the causal effects of Chicago’s community policing program (a community-wide intervention) on neighborhoods’ crime rates. We use semiannual crime data from Chicago to evaluate (1) whether community policing is more effective at decreasing rates of reported personal crime when implemented everywhere versus nowhere in a city; (2) whether community policing is effective if implemented in a single local area, holding constant policing in adjacent areas; (3) whether implementing community policing in surrounding areas affects crime in a focal area; and (4) whether community policing’s impact on crime in surrounding areas depends on whether community policing is also implemented in the focal area. To answer these questions, we relax the no-interference assumption. Our approach allows the potential outcomes in any local area to depend on a function of the treatment assignments in all other units. We define causal effects and evaluate assumptions that make the framework tractable within the framework of a generalized linear model with spatially auto-correlated random effects.},
